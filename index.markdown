<p>
I write stories to make sense of life, and I did this for myself for years
until, lately, I felt the urge to put my stories into plays and share them to
connect to others.  For me, heroes are villains, people are right and wrong,
the glass is half empty and half full, and my stories are about the tension
this creates, the misogynist who is also a good father, the family who
supports you as they break you down, the racism inflicted on us and that we
inflict on others.
